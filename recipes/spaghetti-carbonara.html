    </div><h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Homemade Pepperoni Pizza has everything you want—a great crust, gooey cheese, and tons of pepperoni. The secret to great pepperoni flavor? Hide extra under the cheese! Who needs delivery?</p>
    <h2>Ingredient's</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons fine salt, for the pasta water, plus more to taste as needed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 ounces freshly grated Parmesan cheese, about 3/4 cup</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 ounces diced pancetta, or guanciale or thick bacon</li>
        <li>1 pound pasta, such as spaghetti, bucatini, or fettuccine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add 4 quarts of water and 4 teaspoons of salt to a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks together; add the Parmesan cheese and black pepper and whisk until well blended. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a deep sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes, or until slightly crisp. Turn off burner.</li>
        <li>Once the water reaches a boil, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook following the package instructions for al dente pasta.</li>
        <li>Remove about 1 cup of the pasta water and set it aside. Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved hot pasta water to the pancetta and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the drained pasta and continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk about 1/4 cup of the reserved hot pasta water into the egg and Parmesan cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from heat. Gradually add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, stirring and constantly tossing with tongs until the sauce is silky and clings to the pasta. Add more of the hot pasta water in order to thin the sauce, if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta with extra Parmesan cheese and a generous grinding of black pepper.</li>
    </ul>
